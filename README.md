# Online Test Application

A simple Java-based online test application built using the **Swing Framework**. This project demonstrates a basic multiple-choice quiz system with features like navigation, bookmarking, and result display.

## Features

- **Multiple-choice Questions**: A set of 10 pre-configured questions to test knowledge.  
- **Navigation**:
  - **Next Button**: Move to the next question.  
  - **Bookmark Button**: Save specific questions for later review.  
- **Dynamic Bookmarking**: Automatically generates buttons for bookmarked questions.  
- **Result Display**: Calculates and displays the total number of correct answers at the end.  
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Swing components for a simple and functional interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: Core programming language.  
- **Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.

## Project Structure

- **`OnlineTest` class**: Contains the main application logic.  
  - **Question Bank**: Predefined set of questions and answers.  
  - **Dynamic Navigation**: Handles user interactions like question selection and bookmarking.  
  - **Result Calculation**: Validates answers and calculates the total score.
